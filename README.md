# 42 School - C++ Modules Resolutions

This repository contains the work I did during my journey through the C++ modules at **42 School**. Throughout these projects, I not only solidified my understanding of C++ but also developed a deep appreciation for the complexity and elegance of the language. Coming from a strong foundation in C, this experience allowed me to fully grasp the power and flexibility that C++ offers, especially when it comes to object-oriented programming and memory management.

## ðŸŒŸ What This Work Means to Me

Working on the C++ modules was a transformative experience. It wasn't just about learning the syntax or completing projects; it was about:
- **Shifting from C to C++**: I learned how to approach problems from an object-oriented perspective rather than purely procedural. This was key in changing the way I think about software design and implementation.
- **Memory Management Mastery**: Understanding how to control resources at a low level with C++â€™s manual memory management (using `new`, `delete`, and later, smart pointers) really pushed my knowledge to the next level. It made me appreciate the balance between performance and abstraction.
- **Templates and Generics**: Before this, I had little experience with templates. The ability to write code that adapts to any type made me realize how powerful C++ can be for writing reusable and flexible code.
- **Real-World Applications**: Many of the concepts I worked on here (like inheritance, polymorphism, and the STL) are directly applicable to real-world projects. This prepared me to write better, more maintainable code.

## ðŸš€ The Impact on My Development

Through these projects, I didnâ€™t just become proficient in C++; I became a better programmer overall. By diving deep into:
- **Advanced C++ Concepts**: I now have a solid understanding of inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and templates, which gave me confidence in writing more sophisticated code.
- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Each project presented new challenges that required critical thinking and creative solutions. These exercises sharpened my problem-solving skills, and I now approach coding challenges with a structured and analytical mindset.
- **Attention to Detail**: C++ is a language where small mistakes can lead to large issues (e.g., memory leaks, undefined behavior). This taught me to be meticulous and thorough in both my code and debugging process.

## ðŸ’¡ My Takeaways

- **C++ is a Powerful Extension of C**: While C++ builds on C, it provides far more tools to create complex and efficient software. Learning to utilize the object-oriented features and templates has dramatically improved the quality of my code.
- **Embrace the Complexity**: C++ has a steep learning curve, but embracing its complexity is part of the journey. The deeper I went, the more I understood how the language's features work together to enable performance, abstraction, and control.
- **A New Perspective on Programming**: After completing these modules, I no longer view programming as just writing code that works. Now, I focus on writing code that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

Iâ€™m proud of the work Iâ€™ve done here, and this repository serves as a record of my growth as a C++ developer. It reflects my journey from knowing C to mastering C++ and demonstrates the hard work and dedication it took to get there.
